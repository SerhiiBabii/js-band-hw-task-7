# Homework 7

## Before launching the project it is necessary:

- _Make sure that the **node.js** and **npm** are set. To do this, just write in the terminal._

  > node -v

  If you see a version, for example, "v10.15.1" then everything is okay.

## Instructions for launching the project:

- _Clone this repository_

  > git clone https://github.com/SerhiiBabii/js-band-hw-task-7.git

- _Change directory to project directory and install all dependencies:_

  > cd js-band-hw-task-7

- Run the **"npm i"** command in the terminal. This command will install all the packages that are specified in the **packege.json** file, as well as all their dependencies.

  > npm i

- _Run project:_
  > npm start
